## graphbooks

This is at its core a personal learning project to (re)learn Angular 1.x and
get acquainted with the new and fancy [ES6 syntax](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features).
As such, some technological decisions have been made attending to indefensible criteria such as
"ooh I really want to play with this new tech X".

### the app:

A visualization tool which graphs scifi and fantasy book ratings by author or series, inspired by http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com/

It will use the [Goodreads API](https://www.goodreads.com/api/documentation) for user ratings.

Boilerplate code based on https://github.com/GoThinkster/angular-es6-starterâ€™s course code
